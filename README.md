> This application was developed to provide a clean interface to watch training videos on youtube. The framework used is ReactJS and utilizes javascript, and css. The application uses Axios to call on the youtube api and displays the top search results for the key term used. By default videos by JS are rendered. More features will be added to allow saving of videos and allowing the default term to be changed.
